===================
Official site for *Code for Hampton Roads*
---
Note that branch `gh-pages` is what shows on production codeforhamptonroads.org.  
This `master` branch is what you should edit (in `source` dir) and is generated by
a static-site-generator called http://metalsmith.io

#How to Code for this Repo
Option A: Fork, Edit, then Pull Request when ready to the `master` branch.
Option B: If in the Hampton Road's Brigade and you have write access to repo:
Develop/test in your own branch, preferably a feature-named-branch,
and once it's ready for production, merge into `master`,
which auto deploys to GitHub pages for codeforhamptonroads.org

Also, it's nice if you merge/commit to gh-pages, that you
[let the team know on our Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/forum/#!forum/c4hrva)
if it's anything major.
